### The Big Idea

Looking for the perfect color palette? Let ColorPal help you!

Colors are all around us. But sometimes it is hard to imagine the perfect color combination. So, our project ColorPal is here to suggest the best 5-color paltte based on your main color. And if you are not happy with the combination, don't worry. Just press the refresh button and a new color combination will appear. You could try as many times as your heart desires!

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Main Features

- Home page describing the main function of the website
- Color page where users can input the name of their main color for the palette
- Result page with a generated color palette consisting of five colors and their respective HEX code



## üìå The Details

ColorPal uses the Colormind API key to generate a five-color palette based on one given color. Please, visit the [Colormind API Documentation](http://colormind.io/api-access/) for more information.

The beauty of ColorPal is that users do not need to know the exact RGB code of their main color. When a user inputs a color name, the program will convert it to its relevant RGB color code. This is possible thanks to a database containing all color names and their RGB and HEX information. The returned RGB code is used as an input to the Colormind API key. 

Once the color palette has been generated, the user still has an opportunity to change it. A refresh button appears at the bottom of the screen, which allows for a generation of a new color palette based on the same input color.

The rest is a user-friendly HTML design, whcih allows for an easy usage by everyone. Enjoy!
